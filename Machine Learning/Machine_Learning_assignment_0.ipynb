Here are a few motivational points for why we decided to use Python, and why should you learn it?\n","\n","- It is an extremely powerful programing language and yet very simple to learn and to get started with. ([See what XKCD has to say about it](https://xkcd.com/353/))\n","- It is currently one of the most popular programming languages. ([It is the 3rd most popular language, after C and Java](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/))\n","- Almost all new frameworks in the field of machine learning are python oriented: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.\n","- It has a ridiculously rich set of packages for almost any task. From basic mathematical tools([basic numeric](http://www.numpy.org/), [advance numerics](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [symbolic math](https://www.sympy.org) [data handling](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [visualizing](https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries), etc.), through a range of advanced frameworks for [deep learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/python-deep-learning-frameworks-overview.html), [distributed computing](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing), [web servers](https://www.djangoproject.com/), etc.\n","- It's open-source (=> free++) with a huge community behind it.\n","\n","### Learning Python\n","\n","Learning the basic concepts of the language is relatively easy and is enough in order to get started. In this homework assignment we will try to briefly go through those basics, in order to get you up and running. However, this assignment does not come near of covering all the aspects of the language, and it is expected (and perfectly fine), that if this is your first time using Python it will take you a while (and maybe some frustration) to get the hang of it. This assignment does assume that you do have some minimal experience in programing.\n","\n","You will probably need every now and then to relay on the web for help to solve bugs and to understand parts of the code. There is a large number of great resources available on-line including the official documentation and sited dedicated for learning Python. These resources usually explain thing in a more detailed way that this introduction which. We have listed a few additional resources at the end of this assignment.
